# Covid-detection-using-CT-scans

Computed tomography (CT) scan has a potential role in the diagnosis of Covid-19 and its complications. A large amount of CT data provides a comprehensible analysis of the diagnosis process which in turn produces remarkable quantification and categorization of the severity of the virus inside the afflicted.

The main purpose of this project is to use computer vision and machine learning techniques in effectively detecting and classifying Covid-19. Categorical data will be trained with a collection of CT scans of Covid-19 positive patients and normal individuals and thus reduce the false positive to a great extent as a person affected should not be left undetected.
